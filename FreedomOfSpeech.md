## Freedom of speech

All people should enjoy the right to voice political ideas, no matter how controversial, without suffering political consequences. This can include financial penalties, legal exclusion from the political system, incarceration or any other form of punishment for expressing a point of view.

No political idea can ever be considered as incitement, abuse or harassment in and of itself. Freedom of speech is a guarantee of dissent in times of necessity against any prevailing authoritarian political orthodoxy that would otherwise refuse to be challenged.

No speech should be compelled.
