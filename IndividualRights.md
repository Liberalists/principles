## Individual Rights

All political rights must be universally shared by all adult citizens. The only method by which to secure universal rights is through individual rights enforced by a state that is accountable to the people. Groups may not have rights that supersede the right of the individual.

Each person’s rights must remain sacrosanct. This is the primary protection all people in society must enjoy to ensure justice and there can be no extra-legal justification to violate an individual’s rights.

All rights that can be applied to a citizen must be applied to every citizen, regardless of whether that right is applicable or not.  Rights that have no application to some people presently may be necessary in the future.
