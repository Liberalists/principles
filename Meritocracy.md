## Meritocracy

People should be judged by the content of their character. Promotion  should be on the basis of achievement and should not be unduly inhibited by innate characteristics. Nobody is entitled to receive benefits they did not earn or to which they are not already entitled by being a citizen.

This is not to be misinterpreted as declaration against social safety nets or healthcare, but against individuals or groups claiming unearned benefits, whether social or material, that they otherwise do not deserve.
