## Economic Freedom

Property rights begin with personal self-ownership and extend to any property an individual has legally acquired. The individual must be, as much as possible, in control of their own economic destiny. This includes the right to own property, engage in trade, to sell oneâ€™s own labour or to engage in collective economic activities.
